# DictationBot

DictationBot is a Telegram bot developed for the Faculty of Intelligent Information Technologies and Automation (FÐ†ITA) at Vinnytsia National Technical University (VNTU). This bot was created by a second-year student Max Patyk for the "Vechornytsi" event. It allows an administrator to conduct a poetry dictation, where participants submit their versions of a selected verse.

## Features
- **Room-based dictation**: The administrator creates a room and selects a poem.
- **Submission control**: Users submit poems, but their messages remain hidden.
- **Administrator actions**:
  - Close the room to prevent new participants from joining.
  - End the dictation to stop further submissions.

## Installation
### Prerequisites

4. Configure the bot (set your bot token in an `.env` file or as an environment variable).
